## Project Information

```
Project Name: 3D Super Tic Tac Toe with AI and AR Capabilities

Compelling Problem: Traditional Tic Tac Toe games are limited in their complexity and engagement, lacking modern features such as 3D gameplay, multiplayer support, AI opponents, and augmented reality. This results in a monotonous experience that fails to leverage current technological advancements to create a more dynamic and immersive gaming experience.

Target Audience: Casual gamers, tech enthusiasts, and AR/AI aficionados who enjoy strategic board games and are looking for a modern twist on a classic game. Additionally, this targets educational institutions looking for innovative ways to teach strategy and critical thinking through interactive games.

Our Solution: We are developing a 3D Super Tic Tac Toe game that can be played by up to four players, incorporating both human and AI opponents. The game will be accessible via web browsers with a black background and through AR for an immersive experience in natural environments. This modernized version of Tic Tac Toe leverages 3D graphics, AI, and AR technologies to offer a unique and engaging gameplay experience.
