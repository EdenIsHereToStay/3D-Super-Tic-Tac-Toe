- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for performance across devices.

### Phase 7: Deployment
- **Hosting and Deployment**: Deploy the web app on a reliable hosting service.
- **AR App Distribution**: Distribute the AR app through app stores if needed.

## UI/UX Functionality and User Experience

### User Interface (UI)
- **Main Menu**: Options to start a new game, join a game, or view the tutorial.
- **Game Lobby**: Interface for selecting players (human or AI) and game settings.
- **In-Game UI**: Minimalistic design with a focus on the 3D grid, player indicators, and turn notifications.
- **Settings and Help**: Options for adjusting game settings and accessing help/tutorials.

### User Experience (UX)
- **Intuitive Controls**: Easy navigation and interaction with the game grid.
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across devices, ensuring AR functionality is intuitive.
- **Feedback and Animations**: Smooth transitions, animations for moves, and feedback on game state.
